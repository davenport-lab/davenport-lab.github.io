      <description>Our lab is particularly interested in elucidating the role of host genetics in determining gut microbiome composition. Is the microbiome heritable? What host genetic variants are determine microbial abundance in the gut? How can we use host genetic variation to understand causal relationships between the microbiome and disease?

Microbiome GWAS in the Hutterites While many environmental factors are known to contribute to gut microbiome composition, the extent to which host genetic variation plays a role is unclear.</description>

      <description>The lab is expanding! We are seeking undergraduate researchers, graduate students, and postdocs/research associates.
Undergraduate Researchers Undergraduates interested in gaining research experience examining questions related to host-microbe interactions should reach out to Emily to see whether there are opennings in the lab. Projects in the lab involve bench lab work (wet), computational research (dry), or a combination of both. Prospective researchers should be willing to make a time commitment of at least 8 hours per week to their research during fall and spring semesters.</description>

      <description>Microbiomes of Nepali populations practicing different subsistence strategies How does the transition to agriculture affect the microbiome? In collaboration with Dr. Aashish Jha, we examining the microbiomes of a fascinating set of populations from Nepal that in the past practiced semi-nomadic hunting and gathering. Some of these populations maintain that lifestyle (the Chepang), some took agricultural practices hundreds of years ago (the Tharu), and some have more recently transitioned (the Raute and Raji).</description>

      <description>We are! The Macrobe + microbe interaction lab in the Department of Biology at the Pennsylvania State University. We use a combination of wet lab and computational approaches to understand what determines microbiome composition within a host, and how the relationship between the host and the microbiome affects host health and evolution.

      <description>Microbiome research is a relatively new and rapidly expanding field. New wet lab and statistical approaches are needed to answer fundamental questions about host + microbe interactions. Here&amp;rsquo;s how we are contributing.
Co-occurrence network modeling reveals disease-specific configurations of microbiome community structure Simultaneously modeling host genetics and microbiome composition reveals the heritability and the proportion of variance explained due to the microbiome of immune-related traits 

Co-occurrence network modeling reveals disease-specific configurations of microbiome community structure The human gut microbiome is associated with a large number of complex traits and diseases.</description>

      <description>Seasonal variation in gut microbiome composition Many studies have shown the important role diet plays in determining gut microbiome composition, however, many of us eat fairly consistant diets seasonally because we have access to fresh produce grown all over the globe. To examine whether seasonal differences in diet might affect the microbiome, I examined the fecal bacterial content in an isolated, communally-living population: the Hutterites. Women in Hutterite colonies (a small town of a few hundred Hutterites) cook 3 huge, communal meals a day and the entire colony eats buffet style from that meal (see some photos).</description>
